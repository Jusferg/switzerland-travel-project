              <h4>Grindelwald | Eiger</h4>
              <p>Why is the Eiger so famous?</p>
                The north face, the "last problem" of the Alps, considered amongst the most challenging and dangerous ascents, was first climbed in 1938 by an Austrian-German expedition. 
                The Eiger has been highly publicized for the many tragedies involving climbing expeditions.</p>

              <p></p>
              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>The trail has gorgeous views the entire way and we were lucky to have good weather, but I would not call the hike easy. We are experienced hikers from Colorado with all of the appropriate gear and we found it a bit challenging in spots, although doable for anyone in decent shape with hiking boots, poles and rain gear. It only rained briefly near the bottom. Also don’t believe the signs that say it takes 2 hours. That would only we try for young, very fit and co rodent hikers.

              <h4>Grindelwald | Wengen</h4>
              <p>What is it about Wengen?
                Wengen is a Swiss Alpine village in the Bernese Oberland region. It's known for its timber chalets and belle époque hotels. The Jungfraubahn railway climbs to Jungfrau summit, with views of the Aletsch Glacier from the Sphinx observation deck. 
                A cable car reaches Männlichen’s slopes and trails, with views of Eiger and Mönch peaks. </p>

              <p></p>
              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>Wengen hosts the internationally well-known Lauberhorn ski races, and it is on the route of the Jungfrau Marathon. 
                The classic ski races have been held in Wengen since 1930, and traditionally consist of a downhill, a slalom, and a combined event.

              <h4>Grindelwald</h4>
              <p>Why do people love Grindelwald?
                Grindelwald lies at the base of the Jungfrau ski region, with 155km of local slopes served by a fleet of increasingly modern lifts, affording access to terrain across two varied areas.
                 Its main slopes are shared with Wengen and there is a separate area of sunny pistes on First.</p>

              <p></p>
              <h5>What I like about it</h5>
              <p>An all-season destination, Grindelwald buzzes with ski enthusiasts in the winter and attracts hikers and adrenaline junkies in the summer.
